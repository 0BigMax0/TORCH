TORCH

Let us note the following:

1) This code was developed for Xcode (Mac OSX), but the code
has no specifics to Mac OSX. That is, it is platform-independent.

2) For rendering, it uses the OpenGL + GLUT, so make sure you computer
has these two libraries properly installed. Anyway, the code
can be easily reformulated by removing OpenGL functions and callbacks,
because it also outputs alphanumeric results.

3) The datasets mentioned in the paper 2016-gomes.pdf
